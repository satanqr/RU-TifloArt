This dataset contains over 300 annotated records of artworks with professionally created audio descriptions in Russian, intended for training and fine-tuning multimodal AI models to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.

This dataset was created as part of a research project focused on applying language and multimodal models to generate adapted image descriptions (tiflo-commentaries) in Russian.

# Dataset Composition

- Descriptions: tiflo-commentaries authored by professionals  
- Metadata: genres, styles, color palettes, spatial annotations  
- Auxiliary dictionaries:  
  - Definitions of art genres and styles

# Format

Data is provided in JSON format, with possibility to convert to JSONL for ML/LLM pipelines.

## Legal Status and License

Most tiflo-commentaries are taken from **open sources**, mainly museum and cultural institution websites involved in digital accessibility projects. Texts are not always fully reworked and not all original materials have open licenses. Therefore:

**The author cannot grant an open license for the entire dataset.** The dataset is distributed **for non-commercial research and academic purposes only**.

> ⚠️ Use of the dataset in commercial products or open-license projects requires additional source verification and legal clearance.
